## User Story

This is a website I built for the place where I work. Currently I hav focussed on the UI. I wanted to make a cleaner and more enagaging website that was nicer to use and more functional. 

## Future Development
 
I plan to add a authentication portal that will allow people we work at the center to login and interact. 

I also plan on improving aspects of the front end and finsihing some of the pages.
